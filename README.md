Front-end Developer homework

Overview

This is a homework assignment for a Front-end Developer position at Aiven.

This homework assignment is an opportunity to showcase your technical skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities in developing a practical solution that adds significant value to the user's engagement on our website.

Use React with TypeScript on the front end for the assignment. Other than this, you have the freedom to select tools and libraries.

Your code will only be used for candidate assessment, and will not be shared or used outside of the review process.
Deliverables

    The application should be publicly accessible on a demo site.
    Source code uploaded to the provided Git repository.
    Documentation that outlines your design rationale, development process, testing strategy and considerations for future enhancement.

The assignment

An Aiven customer can launch a service in any of the clouds supported by Aiven's data platform.

Your task is to create a web application for cloud selection with a focus on good user experience leading to conversion. The application should allow users to:

    Filter clouds by the cloud provider (e.g. Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform).
    Sort clouds by their distance from the user. The distance comparison should be based on geolocation.

The available clouds can be listed using Aiven's API.

Additionally, implement a Call to Action (CTA) element on the page. This CTA could be:

    Request a demo
    Free trial

Bonus

Consider incorporating elements to enhance user experience and cater to user needs:

    Pre-selection questionnaire: Before cloud selection, a short questionnaire could help understand user needs (e.g., service to run (kafka, postgresql), budget, processing power, storage requirements). Based on the answers, the application could pre-filter or highlight relevant cloud options. The available services with pricing are listed in Aiven's API
    Caching mechanisms: Implement caching strategies to improve application performance.

While the assignment doesn't require graphic design, consider creative ways to present cloud information. This could involve:

    Interactive maps: Instead of a static list, visualize cloud locations on a map with user location indicated. Clicking on a cloud location could reveal detailed information.

Criteria for evaluation

    The main design goal is to focus on good user experience leading to conversion.
    The solution will be evaluated on:
        Meeting all the assignment requirements
        Code formatting and clarity
        Simple and understandable solution
        Functionality and working application
        Presence of tests and demonstration of those tests
        Error handling
        Demonstrate production quality code, with the exception of graphic design
    Attribution:
        If you use code from external sources, including search results, AI-generated examples, or online repositories, be sure to add attributions.
    Additionally, points will be awarded for:
        Creativity and thoughtfulness in user experience elements.
        Implementing caching mechanisms to improve application performance.
    Go the extra mile! Briefly outline an A/B testing strategy for the application. Outline your hypothesis, potential variations to test, and relevant success metrics. This demonstrates your ability to think beyond the initial build and plan for continuous improvement.

The recommended time for this assignment is approx 7 hours, but you can spend as much or as little time as you like. If you run out of time, please return a partial solution implementing the parts you consider most essential, and describe how you would continue if you had more time. An item in a TODO bullet list can go a long way to show that you're aware of a shortcoming.
The homework template

In this GitHub repository, we have provided a bare bones starter application for the assignment:

    a frontend written in TypeScript and React

You are free to:

    replace or edit the starter code. Or not use it at all, if you feel like it.
    use any other templates for your assignment. Please apply those in a separate commit, and add your code as commits on top.
